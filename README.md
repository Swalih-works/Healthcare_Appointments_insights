The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

* Identify booking patterns by time, demographics, and medical conditions.
* Measure the no-show rate and its influencing factors.
* Compare appointment attendance across different patient groups.
* Provide actionable insights for hospital management to improve patient turnout.
