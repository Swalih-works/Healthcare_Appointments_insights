# Hospital Appointments Analysis with Power BI & MySQL

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital appointment data to uncover trends, patterns, and factors affecting patient attendance. The analysis was performed using **MySQL** for data querying and transformation, and **Power BI** for interactive visualizations.

The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

* Identify booking patterns by time, demographics, and medical conditions.
* Measure the no-show rate and its influencing factors.
* Compare appointment attendance across different patient groups.
* Provide actionable insights for hospital management to improve patient turnout.

The following SQL queries were used for data analysis:

* Retrieve all successful bookings.
* Retrieve all cancelled or missed bookings.
* Total bookings per weekday.
* Bookings with SMS reminders.
* Bookings for patients aged above 60.
